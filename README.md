# Natural Language Processing with Python

Experimenting with Natural Language Processing with Python using NLTK. They're based on the course [Hands On Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python](https://www.udemy.com/hands-on-natural-language-processing-using-python/) but using Jupyter notebooks with personal changes in order for me to try different approaches and learn by doing.

## Experiments
1. NLP Core
  - [Tokenizing words and sentences]()
  - [Stemming the words]()
  - [Lemmatization of words]()
  - [Stopwords removal]()
2. Text Classification
3. Twitter Sentiment Analysis
4. Text Summarization
