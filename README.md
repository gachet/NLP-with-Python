# Natural Language Processing with Python

Experimenting with Natural Language Processing with Python using NLTK. They're based on the course [Hands On Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python](https://www.udemy.com/hands-on-natural-language-processing-using-python/) but using Jupyter notebooks with personal changes in order for me to try different approaches and learn by doing.
